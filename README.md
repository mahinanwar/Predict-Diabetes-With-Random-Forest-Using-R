# Predict-Diabetes-With-Random-Forest-Using-R

The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Data Set: 
It is divided into the following tasks:

Task 1: Load libraries required to execute a Random Forest Model using R and the Pima Indians Data set.  

Task 2:  Perform Exploratory Analysis using ggplot2 to observe the balance of the data, especially as it relates to the Response Variable.

Task 3: Create Testing and Training Data Sets using both the 'base' way and the 'caret' way.

Task 4: Create a Random Forest Model.

Task 5: Analysis and inferences on multiple models using RMSE among other metrics.
